The plot of Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi revolves around the unexpected love story of Surinder and Taani. Surinder is a shy and simple man who works for Punjab Power. He visits the wedding ceremony of Taani, the cheerful daughter of his former teacher Professor Gupta. He falls in love with her at first sight, but is unable to express it. Unfortunately, Taani's fiance and his family die in a road accident, which also causes Professor Gupta to have a heart attack. On his deathbed, he requests Surinder to marry Taani and take care of her. Surinder agrees out of respect and compassion, and Taani reluctantly accepts to fulfill her father's last wish.
 
Surinder and Taani start their married life in Amritsar, but Taani is unable to love Surinder as she is still grieving for her lost love. Surinder tries to make her happy, but she remains depressed and distant. He also faces ridicule from his co-workers for his plain appearance and timid personality. One day, he sees Taani's poster for a dance competition called \"Dancing Jodi\", where couples can participate and win a trip to Japan. He decides to join the competition as Taani's partner, but he knows that she will not accept him as he is. He seeks the help of his friend Bobby, a hairdresser and aspiring actor, who gives him a makeover and teaches him how to act like a confident and charming man.
 
Surinder creates an alter ego named Raj Kapoor, who is a loud and flamboyant actor from Delhi. He wears sunglasses, leather jackets, and spiked hair. He meets Taani at a movie theater and pretends to be a fan of Surinder. He flirts with her and convinces her to be his partner for the dance competition. Taani agrees, thinking that it will be a fun way to escape from her boring life. She does not recognize Raj as Surinder, as he acts completely different from his real self.
 
Raj and Taani start practicing for the dance competition, and gradually become friends. Raj makes Taani laugh with his jokes and antics, and also shows her his romantic side by taking her to various places in Amritsar. He also writes \"I Love You\" all over the city to express his feelings for her. Taani starts to enjoy life again, and develops feelings for Raj. She also feels guilty for betraying Surinder, who she thinks is a good man but not her true love.
 
Surinder faces a dilemma between revealing his true identity to Taani or letting her go with Raj. He decides to sacrifice his love for her happiness, and plans to leave for Delhi after the dance competition. However, on the day of the final round, he sees Taani praying to God to send her a sign if Raj is her soulmate. He realizes that she loves him as Raj, and decides to tell her the truth.
 
He goes on stage as Raj, but before he can dance with Taani, he removes his sunglasses and reveals himself as Surinder. He confesses his love for her and apologizes for lying to her. He tells her that he will set her free from their marriage, and asks her to go with Raj if she loves him. He then leaves the stage in tears.
 
Taani is shocked and confused by Surinder's revelation. She runs after him and stops him from leaving. She tells him that she loves him as both Surinder and Raj, and that he is her true soulmate. She hugs him and kisses him on the cheek. They then go back on stage and perform their dance together as a happy couple.
 
The film ends with Surinder narrating their honeymoon trip to Japan with photographs of their journey.
